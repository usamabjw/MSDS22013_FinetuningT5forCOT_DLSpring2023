It covers 543 km2, of which 135 km2 are a protected area. The park is an area of marshes, shallow streams, and sand dunes in Las Marismas, the delta where the Guadalquivir River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It was established as a nature reserve in 1969 when the World Wildlife Fund joined with the Spanish government and purchased a section of marshes to protect it. The eco-system has been under constant threat by the draining of the marshes, the use of river water to boost agricultural production by irrigating land along the coast, water pollution by upriver mining, and the expansion of tourist facilities. It is named after wife of the seventh Duke of Medina-Sidonia.Sierra de Guadarrama National Park (in Spanish: \"Parque Nacional de la Sierra de Guadarrama\") is a national park in Spain, covering nearly 34,000 hectares, the fifth largest in Spain's national parks system.
